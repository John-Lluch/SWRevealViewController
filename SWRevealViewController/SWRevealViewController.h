 RELEASE NOTES
 
 Version 2.4.0 (Current Version)
 
  - Updated behaviour of appearance method calls on child controllers
  - Removes Xcode 6.3.1 warnings
 
 Version 2.3.0
 
  - StoryBoard initializing bug fix
  - Minor Code refactoring
 
 Version 2.2.0
 
 - State Restoration support.
 - Reverted panGestureRecognizer implementation to before v2.1.0 (works better).
 - New properties 'toggleAnimationType', 'springDampingRatio'. Default reveal animation is 'Spring'
 - New property 'frontViewShadowColor'
 - New properties 'clipsViewsToBounds' and '_extendedPointInsideHit'
 - New delegate methods for finer control of front view location in the overdraw area, as long as deprecation note on former delegate methods
 - Other minor changes that should not affect current implementations
 
 Version 2.1.0
 
 - Removed SWDirectionPanGestureRecognizer. Horizontal panning is filtered on the shouldBegin delegate. This is cleaner, I hope it does not break previous funcionality
 - Took a cleaner approach to storyboard support. SWRevealViewControllerSegue is now deprecated and you should use SWRevealViewControllerSegueSetController and SWRevealViewControllerSeguePushController instead.
 - A minor change on the autoresizingMask of the internal views to fix a glitch on iOS8. This should not affect iOS7
 
 Version 2.0.2
 
 - Added new delegates for better control of gesture recognizers
 
 Version 2.0.1
 
 - Fix: draggableBorderWidth now correctly handles the cases where one of the rear controllers is not provided
 - Fix: the shadow related properties are now granted at any time after view load, not just after initialization.
 
 Version 2.0.0
 
- Dropped support for iOS6 and earlier. This version will only work on iOS7
 
- The method setFrontViewController:animated: does not longer perform a full reveal animation. Instead it just replaces the frontViewController in 
    its current position. Use the new pushFrontViewController:animated: method to perform a replacement of the front controlles with reveal animation
    as in the previous version
    
    IMPORTANT: You must replace all calls to setFrontViewController:animated by calls to pushFrontViewController:animated to prevent breaking
    functionality on existing projects.
 
- Added support for animated replacement of child controllers: setRearViewController, setFrontViewController, setRightViewController now have animated versions.
 
- The new 'replaceViewAnimationDuration' property sets the default duration of child viewController replacement.
 
- Added the following new delegate methods
    revealController:willAddViewController:forOperation:animated:
    revealController:didAddViewController:forOperation:animated:

- The class also supports custom UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning related with the replacement of child viewControllers.
    You can implement the following new delegate method: revealController:animationControllerForOperation:fromViewController:toViewController:
    and provide an object conforming to UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning to implement custom animations.
 
 Version 1.1.3
 
- Reverted the supportedInterfaceOrientations to the default behavior. This is consistent with Apple provided controllers

- The presentFrontViewHierarchically now dynamically takes into account the smaller header height of bars on iPhone landscape orientation
 
 Version 1.1.2
 
 - The status bar style and appearance are now handled in sync with the class animations. 
    You can implement the methods preferredStatusBarStyle and prefersStatusBarHidden on your child controllers to define the desired appearance
    
 - The loadView method now calls a method, loadStoryboardControllers, just for the purpose of loading child controllers from a storyboard.
    You can override this method and remove the @try @catch statements if you want the debugger not to stop at them in case you have set an exception breakpoint.
 
 Version 1.1.1
 
 - You can now get a tapGestureRecognizer from the class. See the tapGestureRecognizer method for more information.
 
 - Both the panGestureRecognizer and the tapGestureRecognizer are now attached to the revealViewController's front content view
    by default, so they will start working just by calling their access methods even if you do not attach them to any of your views.
    This enables you to dissable interactions on your views -for example based on position- without breaking normal gesture behavior.
 
 - Corrected a bug that caused a crash on iOS6 and earlier.
 
 Version 1.1.0

 - The method setFrontViewController:animated now performs the correct animations both for left and right controllers.

 - The class now automatically handles the status bar appearance depending on the currently shown child controller.

 Version 1.0.8
 
 - Support for constant width frontView by setting a negative value to reveal widths. See properties rearViewRevealWidth and rightViewRevealWidth
 
 - Support for draggableBorderWidth. See property of the same name.
 
 - The Pan gesture recongnizer can be disabled by implementing the following delegate method and returning NO
    revealControllerPanGestureShouldBegin:

 - Added the ability to track pan gesture reveal progress through the following new delegate methods
    revealController:panGestureBeganFromLocation:progress:
    revealController:panGestureMovedToLocation:progress:
    revealController:panGestureEndedToLocation:progress:
 
 Previous Versions
 
 - No release notes were updated for previous versions.
