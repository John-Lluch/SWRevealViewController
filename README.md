# SWRevealViewController

A UIViewController subclass for revealing a rear (left and/or right) view controller behind a front controller, inspired by the Facebook app, done right!

## Features

* A Reveal view controller implemented using view controller containment.
* API easier than a UINavigationController.
* Support for any combination of left/right rear controllers.
* Correct handling of appearance methods on its child controllers that you can rely on.
* Correct handling of rotations.
* Can be embedded as a child view controller of other controllers or deployed as the rootViewController.
* Plays nicely with any child view controllers or parent controllers.
* Can be deployed as a child of itself to create cascade-like, hierarchical interfaces.
* Seamless integration of pan gesture recognizer, behaving as smooth as silk.
* A category method on UIViewController, `revealViewController`, to get the parent `SWRevealViewController` of any child controller, similar to the UIViewController's property `navigationController`.
* Lightweight, clean, easy-to-read, self-documenting code that you will enjoy using in your projects.

## Requirements

* iOS 5.1 through iOS 7.0 or later.
* ARC memory management.

## Usage

The SWRevealViewController repository attempts to provide an updated cocoaPods file and consistent tag versioning, but it is not actively updated on the cocoapods-specs repository.

The easiest way to install it is by copying the following to your project:
* SWRevealViewController.h
* SWRevealViewController.m

* Initialize an instance of a SWRevealViewController passing in a "rear" and a "front" view controllers.
* Optionaly add a "right" view controller or pass nil as the "rear" view controller.
* Use the SWRevealViewController instance in your code as you would use any view controller.
* Deploy as the application window rootViewController, or as a child of other containment controllers.
* Get the panGestureRecognized and tapGestureRecognizer provided by the SWRevealViewController. You can add them to a suitable view on your "front" view controller. For example add the panGestureRecognizer to a navigationBar on the viewDidLoad method of your front controller.
* At any time, you can reveal, conceal the "rear" or "right" views or replace any of the view controllers, programmatically or based on user actions, with or without animations enabled

## Basic API Description

Initializing a SWRevealViewController:

    - (id)initWithRearViewController:(UIViewController *)rearViewController frontViewController:(UIViewController *)frontViewController;

Setting a right view controller:

	@property (strong, nonatomic) UIViewController *rightViewController;
	
Animated setting of the front view controller:

    - (void)setFrontViewController:(UIViewController *)frontViewController animated:(BOOL)animated;

Animating the position of the front view controller. Position can be: `FrontViewPositionLeftSideMostRemoved`, `FrontViewPositionLeftSideMost`, `FrontViewPositionLeftSide`, `FrontViewPositionLeft`, `FrontViewPositionRight`, `FrontViewPositionRightMost` or `FrontViewPositionRightMostRemoved`

	- (void)setFrontViewPosition:(FrontViewPosition)frontViewPosition animated:(BOOL)animated;
	
Creating and obtaining a pan gesture recognizer:

	- (UIPanGestureRecognizer*)panGestureRecognizer;

Creating and obtaining a tap gesture recognizer:

	- (UITapGestureRecognizer*)tapGestureRecognizer;
	
Other methods are documented in the SWRevealViewController.h header file. 


## Release Notes

As of November 15, 2013 Release Notes are updated on the class main header file. Please see `SWRevealViewController.h`

## Tutorial

Some time ago the guys at AppCoda published an online tutorial featuring the SWRevealViewController: "How To Add a Slide-out Sidebar Menu in Your Apps" (thanks for that). You will find it at http://www.appcoda.com/ios-programming-sidebar-navigation-menu/ . Not updated to the last SWRevealViewController version but still worth a read.

## Xamarin Binding

Thanks to Jesper Vandborg for having contributed with a Xamarin Binding project for this controller that is available for download at https://github.com/Vandborg/SWRevealViewController-XamarinBinding.

## Special Mentions

A Special Thank you to Joan Martin who formely worked at http://www.sweetwilliamsl.com and has recently been developing an app for http://www.citizen.tv. He had the original idea and implemented code for generic view deployment/undeployment and replacement of view controllers used in the class. 

Early code and api was inspired on a similar class by Philip Kluz (Philip.Kluz@zuui.org)
