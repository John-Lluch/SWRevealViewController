# SWRevealViewController

A UIViewController subclass for revealing a rear (left and/or right) view controller behind a front controller, inspired by the Facebook app, done right!


## NOTE ( Upgrading to Version 2.1)

This version incorporates a new approach to Story Boards support. 

* There are now two different segue classes, SWRevealViewControllerSegueSetController and SWRevealViewControllerSeguePushController. The first one is meant to set the revealViewController with the initial controllers from the story board. The second one is used to push controllers to the front with animation. The former SWRevealViewControllerSegue still works but it has been deprecated.
* A new StoryBoard example, RevealControllerStoryBoardExample2, has been added to demonstrate the use of the new segue classes. More responsability has been moved to the Story Board design while simplifying the SWRevealViewController implementation.

## IMPORTANT NOTE: (Upgrading to Version 2.0)

A number of changes have been made on version 2.0 that may break your existing project. In case you are not ready to upgrade you can continue using previous versions. The last commit before 2.0.0 was tagged v1.1.3. The important changes that affect 2.0.0 are described next. 

* Dropped support for iOS6 and earlier. This version will only work on iOS7

* The method `setFrontViewController:animated:` does no longer behave as previously. Particularly, it does not perform a full reveal animation. Instead it just replaces the frontViewController at its current position with optional animation. Use the new `pushFrontViewController:animated:` method as a replacement for your previous calls to `setFrontViewController:animated:`.

* Added support for animated replacement of child controllers. The methods `setRearViewController`, `setFrontViewController`, `setRightViewController` now all have animated versions. The default animation is a Cross Dissolve effect. You can set the duration of the view controller replacement animation with `replaceViewAnimationDuration`

* You can create custom viewController transition animations by providing an object implementing the `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` protocol.

* Added the following new delegate methods
```
    - (void)revealController:(SWRevealViewController *)revealController willAddViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController forOperation:(SWRevealControllerOperation)operation animated:(BOOL)animated;
    - (void)revealController:(SWRevealViewController *)revealController didAddViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController forOperation:(SWRevealControllerOperation)operation animated:(BOOL)animated;
    - (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)revealController:(SWRevealViewController *)revealController animationControllerForOperation:(SWRevealControllerOperation)operation fromViewController:(UIViewController *)fromVC toViewController:(UIViewController *)toVC;
```

* The examples have been updated to demonstrate the new features. All animated calls to `setFrontViewController:animated:` have been replaced by calls to `pushFrontViewController:animated:`. The RevealControllerProject example implements a custom Animation Controller (`UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning`) to perform a slide up transition on replacement of the rightViewController. The RevealControllerProject3 example uses the default Cross Dissolve animation to set the Front Controller.


## Features

* A Reveal view controller implemented using view controller containment.
* Support for custom viewController transition animations through UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning protocol
* API easier than a UINavigationController.
* Support for any combination of left/right rear controllers.
* Correct handling of appearance methods on its child controllers that you can rely on.
* Correct handling of rotations.
* Can be embedded as a child view controller of other controllers or deployed as the rootViewController.
* Plays nicely with any child view controllers or parent controllers.
* Can be deployed as a child of itself to create cascade-like, hierarchical interfaces.
* Seamless integration of pan gesture recognizer, behaving as smooth as silk.
* A category method on UIViewController, `revealViewController`, to get the parent `SWRevealViewController` of any child controller, similar to the UIViewController's property `navigationController`.
* Comprehensive set of delegate methods for getting full state of the controller and implementing your own code hooks for customizing behavior.
* Lightweight, clean, easy-to-read, self-documenting code that you will enjoy using in your projects.

## Requirements

* iOS 7.0 or later.
* ARC memory management.

## Usage

The SWRevealViewController repository attempts to provide an updated cocoaPods file and consistent tag versioning, but it is not actively updated on the cocoapods-specs repository.

The easiest way to install it is by copying the following to your project:
* SWRevealViewController.h
* SWRevealViewController.m

On your project:
* Initialize an instance of a SWRevealViewController passing in a "rear" and a "front" view controllers.
* Optionaly add a "right" view controller or pass nil as the "rear" view controller.
* Use the SWRevealViewController instance in your code as you would use any view controller.
* Deploy as the application window rootViewController, or as a child of other containment controllers.
* Get the panGestureRecognized and tapGestureRecognizer provided by the SWRevealViewController. You can leave them as they are for the default behavior or you can add them to a suitable view on your "front" view controller. For example add the panGestureRecognizer to a navigationBar on the viewDidLoad method of your front controller.
* At any time, you can reveal, conceal the "rear" or "right" views or replace any of the view controllers, programmatically or based on user actions, with or without animations enabled

## Basic API Description

Initializing a SWRevealViewController:

    - (id)initWithRearViewController:(UIViewController *)rearViewController frontViewController:(UIViewController *)frontViewController;

Setting a right view controller:

    @property (strong, nonatomic) UIViewController *rightViewController;
	
Animated setting of the front view controller:

    - (void)pushFrontViewController:(UIViewController *)frontViewController animated:(BOOL)animated;

Animating the position of the front view controller. Position can be: `FrontViewPositionLeftSideMostRemoved`, `FrontViewPositionLeftSideMost`, `FrontViewPositionLeftSide`, `FrontViewPositionLeft`, `FrontViewPositionRight`, `FrontViewPositionRightMost` or `FrontViewPositionRightMostRemoved`

    - (void)setFrontViewPosition:(FrontViewPosition)frontViewPosition animated:(BOOL)animated;
	
Creating and obtaining a pan gesture recognizer:

    - (UIPanGestureRecognizer*)panGestureRecognizer;

Creating and obtaining a tap gesture recognizer:

    - (UITapGestureRecognizer*)tapGestureRecognizer;
	
Other methods are documented in the SWRevealViewController.h header file. 

## Release Notes

As of November 15, 2013 Release Notes are updated on the class main header file. Please see `SWRevealViewController.h`

## Tutorials

* Some time ago the guys at AppCoda published an online tutorial featuring the SWRevealViewController: "How To Add a Slide-out Sidebar Menu in Your Apps" (thanks for that). You will find it at http://www.appcoda.com/ios-programming-sidebar-navigation-menu/ . Not updated to the last SWRevealViewController version but still worth a read.

* Tammy Coron on Ray Wenderlich blog made an excelent tutorial on "how to build a slide-out navigation panel". She recomends the SWRevealViewController in case you do not want to implement one yourself. http://www.raywenderlich.com/32054/how-to-create-a-slide-out-navigation-like-facebook-and-path

* You can also check "Drawer View iOS App with SWRevealViewController" at http://bcdilumonline.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/drawer-view-ios-app-with.html for step by step instructions on how to install and use the controller. Worth a read for those who do not quite feel at home with storyboards :-)  

* I also found this one in Spanish "Sidebar o menú lateral mediante SWRevealViewController" by wikimovil.es at http://wikimovil.es/sidebar-o-menu-lateral-mediante-swrevealviewcontroller-parte-1/ which is doing a good job with detailed explanations on how to implement it using Story Boards (before V2.1)

## Xamarin Binding

Thanks to Jesper Vandborg for having contributed with a Xamarin Binding project for this controller that is available for download at https://github.com/Vandborg/SWRevealViewController-XamarinBinding.

## Special Mentions

A Special Thank you to Joan Martin who formely worked at http://www.sweetwilliamsl.com and has recently been developing an app for http://www.citizen.tv. He had the original idea and implemented code for generic view deployment/undeployment and replacement of view controllers used in the class. 

Early code and api was inspired on a similar class by Philip Kluz (Philip.Kluz@zuui.org)
